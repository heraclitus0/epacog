# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Epacog**.

Epacog is not a conventional framework—it is a programmable epistemic control system grounded in formal recursion logic (RCC), memory continuity (CT), and volatility-aware rupture mechanics (VC). Contributions must reflect this foundation.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Maintain Logical Integrity**: Contributions should align with core epistemic constructs. If it cannot be explained in terms of recursive distortion, realignment, rupture, or collapse—it likely doesn’t belong here.

- **No Static Defaults**: All behavior—realignment, rupture, collapse, thresholds—must remain dynamic, programmable, and overridable.

- **Explain Symbolically**: Every new operator, threshold, or collapse model must be accompanied by its symbolic interpretation—not just implementation details.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch.
2. **Write tests** under `/tests` for any new feature or behavior.
3. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - A clear description of the epistemic logic being introduced or modified.
   - Rationale for how it integrates with existing RCC/CT/VC based mechanics.
